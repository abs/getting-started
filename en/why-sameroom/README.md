You are a **teacher** with a class of 50 students. You like Slack as an intra-organizational platform. You would like to have a common informational two-way Slack channel (for example, “What to read”) shared with your students

Further, you know that some of your students are using Skype pretty frequently and they are not going to switch to any other messaging system; some other students are familiar with HipChat; some others prefer the Email platform; and the rest would like to try something new to access your channels.

Sameroom allows your students and you communicate using several different platforms.

Here are the steps to achieve that:

1. You create a so-called Portal for each of your Slack channels
2. You send that Portal (which is just an URL) to each of your students (over email, for example)
3. Each of your students clicks on that Portal URL, selects her Platform (like Skype), and connects one of their existing rooms (or channels, or flows) to your “What to read” Slack channel.

So, each of 51 members of your network is using a Platform of their preference now. Bingo!

Note 1: You can replace “**teacher**” in our example by “admin”, “CEO”, “expert”, “service representative”, “contractor”, “family member”, or something else.

Note 2: You can replace “**Slack**” in our example by “Campfire”, “Flowdock”, “Gitter”, “HipChat”, “IRC”, “Kato”, or ”Skype”.

Note 3: The Email Platform is special (and, by the way, it is not an instant messaging service anyway).
