  2. Whenever you are ready to publish your work, add all the articles under your language to [`util/manifest.json`](https://github.com/sameroom/getting-started/blob/master/util/manifest.json) (create a new language entry if necessary).

* When linking to other articles within your language section, make sure to prepend all links with `/articles/<language>/`.
* We'll review your pull request, merge with the mainline, and roll it out to [sameroom.io/getting-started](http://sameroom.io/getting-started).
